#### Environments

###### Python&ensp;3.0.0 or newer<br>
* I do suggest you use python 3 which is both stable and widely used nowadays.
* The code also works well with python 2 since I just use numpy and matplotlib.

#### Packages

###### numpy<br>
###### matplotlib<br>
* The requirement to the version of these packages is not strict, because we just use the basic function.  
* I want to remind you that even the same operator can have different meanings between matrix and array in numpy.
* The tools used to read image is matplotlib which in the order of RGB while cv2 is in the order of BGR. From this perspective, I strongly suggest that it's a better way to use the same package load image and show the result.
