#### Environments

###### &emsp;Python&ensp;3.0.0 or newer<br>
* I do suggest you use python 3 which is both stable and widely used nowadays.
* The code also works well with python 2 since I just use numpy and matplotlib.

#### Packages

###### &emsp;numpy<br>
###### &emsp;matplotlib<br>
* The requirement to the version of these packages is not strict, because we just use the basic function.  
* The tools used to read image is matplotlib which is in the order of RGB while cv2 is in the order of BGR.
* I want to remind you that even the same operator can have different meanings between matrix and array in numpy.

#### Methods

* ###### &emsp;[Dark Channel Prior](http://kaiminghe.com/publications/cvpr09.pdf)<br>
###### &emsp;[Guided Image Filter](http://kaiminghe.com/publications/eccv10guidedfilter.pdf)<br>
